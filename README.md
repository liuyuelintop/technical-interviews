## 🚀 How to Use This Repository

### For Interview Preparation
1. **Start with [Learning Path](./docs/learning-path.md)** to understand recommended order
2. **Read [Architectural Thinking Guide](./docs/architectural-thinking.md)** to develop the right mindset
3. **Pick a problem** from the appropriate difficulty level
4. **Try solving it yourself first** (30-60 min)
5. **Review the architectural guide** to understand the thinking process
6. **Compare with the solution** and learn from differences
7. **Rebuild from scratch** to solidify understanding
