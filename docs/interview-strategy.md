- [ ] Practice staying calm under pressure

**Logistics:**
- [ ] Test your setup (camera, microphone, internet)
- [ ] Prepare your environment (quiet, clean background)
- [ ] Have backup internet connection ready
- [ ] Charge all devices

---

### Day Before Interview

**Do:**
- Light review of notes
- One easy problem for confidence
- Get good sleep
- Prepare clothes (if in-person)
- Relax and trust your preparation

**Don't:**
- Cram new topics
- Do hard problems
- Stay up late
- Stress about what you don't know

---

## During the Interview

### Phase 1: Understanding the Problem (5-10 min)

#### Listen Carefully
```
Good: *Taking notes while interviewer explains*
Bad: *Interrupting or starting to code immediately*
```

#### Ask Clarifying Questions

**Template Questions:**

**Scope & Requirements:**
- "Just to confirm, the main requirements are [summarize]?"
- "Are there any requirements beyond what you mentioned?"
- "What's more important: feature completeness or code quality?"

**Technical Constraints:**
- "Are there any constraints on libraries or frameworks I can use?"
- "Should I assume any specific browser support?"
- "Is there a preference between [approach A] and [approach B]?"

**Edge Cases:**
- "How should the app handle [edge case]?"
- "What happens if [error scenario]?"
- "Should I implement error handling?"

**Time Management:**
- "How much time do I have for this?"
- "Should I focus on getting basic functionality working first?"
- "Would you like me to write tests?"

#### Restate the Problem

```
"Let me make sure I understand correctly:
- I need to build [feature]
- It should [requirement 1]
- It should [requirement 2]
- The main user flow is [describe flow]
Does that sound right?"
```

This shows:
- You listen carefully
- You think before coding
- You want to solve the RIGHT problem

---

### Phase 2: Planning the Solution (5-10 min)

#### Think Out Loud

**Template:**
```
"Let me think through the architecture:

For data management, I'm thinking of using [approach] because [reason].

For the component structure, I'll need:
- [Component A] for [purpose]
- [Component B] for [purpose]
- [Component C] for [purpose]

For state management, I'll use [approach] because [reason].

Does this approach make sense, or would you like me to consider something else?"
```

#### Sketch if Helpful

```
"Would it be helpful if I quickly sketch the component tree?"
or
"Let me draw the data flow to make sure we're aligned"
```

Visual aids show:
- Structured thinking
- Communication skills
- Architectural awareness

#### Discuss Trade-offs

```
"I'm considering two approaches:

Approach A: [description]
  Pros: [benefits]
  Cons: [drawbacks]

Approach B: [description]
  Pros: [benefits]
  Cons: [drawbacks]

Given [context], I'll go with Approach A because [reasoning].
Sound good?"
```

This shows:
- You consider alternatives
- You understand trade-offs
- You make reasoned decisions

---

### Phase 3: Implementation (60-90 min)

#### Start Simple

```
Good: Build working version first, then add features
Bad: Try to build perfect solution with all features at once
```

**Build Order:**
1. Basic structure (types, components)
2. Core functionality (must-have features)
3. Error handling
4. Edge cases
5. Polish and optimization

#### Communicate While Coding

**Template Phrases:**

While typing:
- "I'm creating a [component] that will [purpose]"
- "I'm using [pattern] here because [reason]"
- "This handles the case where [scenario]"

When making decisions:
- "I'm choosing [option] over [alternative] because [reason]"
- "For this, I prefer [approach] as it's more [benefit]"

When stuck:
- "Let me think through this for a moment..."
- "I'm considering how to handle [scenario]"
- "What would you suggest for [problem]?"

#### Test as You Go

```
Good: Test each feature as you build it
Bad: Write all code then test at the end
```

**Testing Strategy:**
- Run code after each major feature
- Fix bugs immediately
- Console.log to verify behavior
- Test edge cases

---

### Phase 4: Review & Refine (10-15 min)

#### Walk Through Your Code

```
"Let me walk through what I built:

1. When the app loads, [describe flow]
2. When the user [action], [describe flow]
3. If [edge case], [describe handling]

The main architectural decisions were:
- [Decision 1] because [reason]
- [Decision 2] because [reason]
"
```

#### Discuss Improvements

```
"Given more time, I would:
1. [Improvement 1] - This would [benefit]
2. [Improvement 2] - This would [benefit]
3. [Improvement 3] - This would [benefit]

I prioritized [what you did] because [reason]."
```

#### Answer Questions Confidently

When you know:
- Answer directly and clearly
- Provide reasoning
- Give examples if helpful

When you don't know:
- Be honest: "I'm not familiar with that, but I would [approach to learn]"
- Never fake knowledge
- Show problem-solving: "I don't know, but here's how I'd figure it out..."

## Common Interview Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Interviewer is Silent

**What it means:** They want to see your thinking process

**What to do:**
- Think out loud more
- Explain each decision
- Ask if they have feedback
- Keep communication flowing

**Don't:**
- Panic
- Assume you're doing poorly
- Stop communicating

---

### Scenario 2: Running Out of Time

**What to do:**
1. Assess what's left
2. Prioritize ruthlessly
3. Communicate: "I have 15 minutes left. Should I focus on [X] or [Y]?"
4. Build working version of highest priority
5. Explain what you'd add with more time

**Don't:**
- Rush and write buggy code
- Try to do everything
- Give up

---

### Scenario 3: Stuck on a Bug

**What to do:**
1. Stay calm
2. Debug systematically:
   - Read error message
   - Add console.logs
   - Check assumptions
   - Trace data flow
3. Think out loud while debugging
4. Ask for hint if genuinely stuck (5-10 min)

**Don't:**
- Panic
- Keep trying random things
- Sit in silence

---

### Scenario 4: Interviewer Challenges Your Approach

**What it means:** They want to see how you handle feedback

**What to do:**
1. Listen carefully
2. Acknowledge their point
3. Ask clarifying questions
4. Discuss trade-offs
5. Be willing to adapt

**Example:**
```
Interviewer: "Why not use Redux for state?"

You: "That's a good point. Redux would provide [benefits].
I chose local state because [reasoning], but I can see how
Redux would be better if [scenarios]. Would you like me to
refactor to use Redux, or discuss the trade-offs?"
```

**Don't:**
- Get defensive
- Dismiss their suggestion
- Stubbornly stick to your approach

---

## Handling Different Interview Formats

### Live Coding (Video Call)

**Advantages:** Real-time feedback, can ask questions

**Strategy:**
- Communicate constantly
- Share screen clearly
- Test frequently
- Ask for feedback regularly

---

### Take-Home Assignment

**Advantages:** No time pressure, can research

**Strategy:**
- Read requirements multiple times
- Plan before coding
- Write clean, documented code
- Include README with:
  - Setup instructions
  - Architecture decisions
  - Trade-offs made
  - Future improvements
- Add tests if time permits
- Polish the UI
- Commit frequently with good messages

---

### Whiteboard/Design Interview

**Advantages:** Focus on thinking, not syntax

**Strategy:**
- Sketch component trees
- Diagram data flow
- Discuss patterns and architectures
- Write pseudocode, not perfect syntax
- Focus on trade-offs and reasoning

---

## Recovering from Mistakes

### Made a Wrong Assumption?
```
"I just realized I misunderstood [requirement]. Let me adjust
my approach to handle [correct requirement]."
```

### Found a Bug?
```
"I see there's a bug in [component]. This is happening because
[reason]. Let me fix that."
```

### Went Down Wrong Path?
```
"I think [current approach] might not be optimal. Would it make
sense to try [alternative approach] instead?"
```

**Key:** Acknowledge, explain, adapt. Don't try to hide mistakes.

## After the Interview

### Immediate Post-Interview

**Do:**
- Send thank you email within 24 hours
- Reflect on what went well and what didn't
- Write down questions you struggled with
- Note topics to review

**Thank You Email Template:**
```
