# How to Use This Repository

## Overview

This repository is designed to help you prepare for technical interviews by teaching you **how to think architecturally**, not just how to code.

## Learning Approaches

### Approach 1: Interview Simulation (Recommended)

**Goal:** Simulate real interview conditions

**Steps:**
1. Read README.md (problem statement only)
2. Set a timer (90 minutes)
3. Try to solve it yourself completely
4. DON'T look at guides or solution
5. When done (or time's up), review ARCHITECTURAL_GUIDE.md
6. Compare your approach with the guide
7. Review IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
8. Compare your code with solution/
9. Note differences in thinking
10. Rebuild from scratch applying what you learned

**Time:** 3-4 hours per problem

**Best for:** Practicing under pressure, interview prep

---

### Approach 2: Guided Learning

**Goal:** Learn architectural thinking step-by-step

**Steps:**
1. Read README.md (problem statement)
2. Read REQUIREMENTS.md
3. Try to analyze requirements yourself
4. Read ARCHITECTURAL_GUIDE.md Phase 1 (Requirements Analysis)
5. Compare with your analysis
6. Read ARCHITECTURAL_GUIDE.md Phase 2 (Data Modeling)
7. Try to design types yourself
8. Compare with the guide
9. Continue through all phases
10. Then try implementing yourself
11. Use IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md as reference when stuck
12. Review solution/ after completing

**Time:** 4-6 hours per problem

**Best for:** Deep learning, building strong foundation

---

### Approach 3: Tutorial Mode

**Goal:** Learn by building along with the guide

**Steps:**
1. Read README.md and REQUIREMENTS.md
2. Read entire ARCHITECTURAL_GUIDE.md first
3. Follow IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md step-by-step
4. Type every line yourself (no copy-paste!)
5. Understand each step before moving forward
6. After completing, close everything
7. Try building again from memory
8. Repeat until you can build without reference

**Time:** 2-3 hours per problem (plus rebuilds)

**Best for:** Learning new technologies, building confidence

---

### Approach 4: Variation Practice

**Goal:** Explore different architectural approaches

**Steps:**
1. Complete the problem using one of the above approaches
2. Explore variations/ directory
3. Study alternative implementations
4. Understand trade-offs between approaches
5. Try implementing another variation yourself
6. Example: Built with useState? Try building with Zustand

**Time:** 2-3 hours per variation

**Best for:** Understanding trade-offs, advanced learning

## Recommended Learning Path

### Phase 1: Foundations (Weeks 1-2)
- Read docs/architectural-thinking.md
- Start with 2-3 BEGINNER problems
- Use **Guided Learning** approach
- Focus on understanding, not speed

### Phase 2: Practice (Weeks 3-4)
- Move to INTERMEDIATE problems
- Use **Tutorial Mode** for first problem
- Use **Guided Learning** for rest
- Start noticing patterns

### Phase 3: Mastery (Weeks 5-6)
- Continue with INTERMEDIATE problems
- Switch to **Interview Simulation** mode
- Time yourself
- Focus on speed and communication

### Phase 4: Interview Ready (Week 7+)
- Mix of INTERMEDIATE and ADVANCED
- Always use **Interview Simulation** mode
- Practice explaining decisions out loud
- Do mock interviews with friends

---

## Difficulty Levels

### BEGINNER
- **Time:** 60-90 minutes
- **Complexity:** Single feature, basic state
- **Technologies:** React basics, simple TypeScript
- **Examples:** Todo app, simple form, user list

### INTERMEDIATE
- **Time:** 90-120 minutes
- **Complexity:** Multiple features, complex state, API integration
- **Technologies:** React Query, custom hooks, localStorage
- **Examples:** User directory with filters, shopping cart, dashboard

### ADVANCED
- **Time:** 120-180 minutes
- **Complexity:** Complex business logic, performance optimization, multiple data sources
- **Technologies:** Advanced patterns, optimization, real-time updates
- **Examples:** Rich text editor, data visualization, real-time chat

## Tips for Success

### 1. Type, Don't Copy
- Always type code yourself
- Muscle memory matters
- Understand each line

### 2. Focus on Understanding
- Don't just memorize solutions
- Understand WHY, not just WHAT
- Learn the thinking process

### 3. Practice Communication
- Explain decisions out loud
- Practice talking while coding
- Record yourself and review

### 4. Build Multiple Times
- First time: Learn
- Second time: Reinforce
- Third time: Internalize

### 5. Track Your Progress
- Keep notes on what you learned
- Track time for each problem
- Note areas needing improvement

### 6. Don't Rush
- Understanding > Speed
- Speed comes with practice
- Focus on correctness first
