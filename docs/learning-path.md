5. Review guides after
6. Compare approaches

**Time:** 12-15 hours

---

### Week 6: Polish and Advanced Topics

**Objectives:**
- Handle advanced problems
- Explore variations
- Solidify understanding

**Activities:**
1. Try 1 ADVANCED problem
2. Explore variations/ directories
3. Rebuild previous problems with different approaches
4. Do mock interview with friend

**Time:** 10-12 hours

---

## Phase 4: Interview Ready (Week 7+)

### Ongoing Practice

**Objectives:**
- Maintain skills
- Stay sharp
- Keep learning

**Activities:**
1. One problem per week (timed)
2. Contribute new problems
3. Help others in discussions
4. Do real interviews!

**Time:** 2-3 hours per week

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Rushing Through Problems
**Problem:** Moving to next problem without fully understanding
**Solution:** Rebuild each problem at least once

### 2. Copy-Pasting Code
**Problem:** No muscle memory, don't understand deeply
**Solution:** Always type every line yourself

### 3. Skipping Architectural Guides
**Problem:** Learn HOW but not WHY
**Solution:** Always read architectural guides, even if you solved it

### 4. Not Timing Yourself
**Problem:** No sense of interview pace
**Solution:** Time yourself starting week 3

### 5. Working in Isolation
**Problem:** No feedback, miss blind spots
**Solution:** Explain solutions to friends, join communities

## Adjusting the Path

### If You're Struggling
- Spend more time on foundations
- Do more BEGINNER problems before moving up
- Use Tutorial Mode for more problems
- Take breaks and review concepts

### If You're Moving Fast
- Jump to INTERMEDIATE problems sooner
- Try ADVANCED problems earlier
- Focus on variations and alternatives
- Contribute new problems to repo

### If You Have Less Time
- Focus on one path (e.g., just React)
- Do one problem per week minimum
- Use Tutorial Mode more to save time
- Extend timeline to 10-12 weeks

### If Interview is Soon (< 2 weeks)
- Focus on INTERMEDIATE problems only
- Do Interview Simulation mode exclusively
- One problem per day
- Review key architectural concepts daily
